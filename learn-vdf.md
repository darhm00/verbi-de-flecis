# Phonology & spelling
WIP.

# Basic sentences (Lesson I)
Basic sentences (e.g. I eat pizza) are made with `subject +
verb + object` (same as in english), these are some examples:
 - go eda ik edantu (I eat this food);
 - tu vastas a il urbis (You went to that city);

 - is varat a sea dumus (he will go to his house);
 - kania ustint bela (dogs are cool).

# Articles (Lesson II)
There are 4 articles:
 - indefinite;
 - possessive;
 - demonstrative (a);
 - demonstrative (b).

**NOTE<sub>1</sub>**: nouns are definite by default. <br>
**NOTE<sub>2</sub>**: 2 articles cannot be used together. <br>
**NOTE<sub>3</sub>**: there are **no** plural articles. <br>

## Indefinite article
The indefinite article is `un`, the article comes before the noun, here are
some examples:
 - *un* kani (a dog);
 - *un* vir (a boy/a man);
 - *un* fomin (a girl/ a woman);
 - *un* fomina (some girls/ some women).

As you can see plural article is translated as `some + noun`.

## Possessive articles
Possessive articles are like possessive adjectives in english, there are 6
possessive articles, 1 for each pronoun:

| Person | Singular          | Plural       |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1st    | mea (my)          | nea  (our)   |
| 2nd    | tea (your)        | vea  (your)  |
| 3rd    | sea (his/her/its) | esea (their) |

these are some examples:
 - *mea* dumus (my house);
 - *esea* patr (their father);
 - *tea* urbis (your city);

## Demonstrative articles (a & b)
As you saw earlier there are 2 demonstrative article (of type a and of type b),
which corresponds to the english `this` and `that`, in fact, the demonstrative
articles replace the demonstratives adjectives, let's see some examples:
 - *ik* kani (this dog);
 - *il* res (that thing);
 - *ik* dantis (this worker);
 - *il* fomina (that woman);

The demonstrative articles of type a is `ik` (translated as `this`) and the
demonstrative article of type b is `il` (translated as `that`)

## Exercises
Translate the following sentences in english:
 - mea kani;
 - esea dumus;
 - ik dantis;
 - ik fomina;

Translate the following sentences in VDF:
 - a dog;
 - my dog;
 - some workers;
 - this woman;
 - the man;

# Adjectives (Lesson III)
To get more specific about something we need to use adjectives and other nouns,
every noun specifying something comes after the noun, let's see some examples:
 - mea kani *bel* (my cool dog);
 - ik dumus *pavus* (this little house);
 - ofik *magus* (the big office);

**NOTE**: Normally adjectives end with `us` and adjectives have the same number
of the noun (e.g. dumus**a** magus**a**, the big house).

# Present to be verb & pronouns (Lesson IV)
The present of the verb to be is irregular, it's the only irregular verb in the
entire verb list, here is the conjugation:

| Person | Singular              | Plural                |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 1st    | go su (I am)          | nos ustmi (we are)    |
| 2nd    | tu us (you are)       | vos usti (you are)    |
| 3rd    | is ust (he/she/it is) | eis ustint (they are) |

the pronouns are as shown in the table (note that the subject can be omitted),
these are some examples:
 - ik dumus *ust* pavus sed bel (this house is small but cool);
 - go *su* un vir (I am a man);
 - eis *ustint* un fomina (they are some women).

this is the conjugation of the phrase `to be big` in the present form:

| Person | Singular     | Plural            |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1st    | go su magus  | nos ustmi magusa  |
| 2nd    | tu us magus  | vos usti magusa   |
| 3rd    | is ust magus | eis ustint magusa |

**NOTE**: To negate a verb put `nu` before the verb (go *nu* su magus, I am not
big).

## Exercises (Lesson IV)
Conjugate the phrase `to be small`, `to be a worker` and `to not be a woman` in
the present form. <br>

Translate to VDF the following sentences:
 - I am not a worker;
 - that thing is a city;
 - it is a dog;
 - it isn't a dog;

Translate to English the following sentences:
 - Go su pavus;

 - Ik dumus nu us pavus, il res ust magus!
