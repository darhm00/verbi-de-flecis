# Phonology & spelling
WIP.

# Basic sentences (Lesson I)
Basic sentences (e.g. I eat pizza) are made with `subject +
verb + object` (same as in english), these are some examples:
 - go eda ik edantu (I eat this food);
 - tu vastas a il urbis (You went to that city);

 - is varat a sea dumus (he will go to his house);
 - kania ustint bela (dogs are cool).

# Articles (Lesson II)
There are 4 articles:
 - indefinite;
 - possessive;
 - demonstrative (a);
 - demonstrative (b).

**NOTE<sub>1</sub>**: nouns are definite by default.
**NOTE<sub>2</sub>**: 2 articles cannot be used together.
**NOTE<sub>3</sub>**: there are **no** plural articles.

## Indefinite article
The indefinite article is `un`, the article comes before the noun, here are
some examples:
 - un kani (a dog);
 - un vir (a boy/a man);
 - un fomin (a girl/ a woman);
 - un fomina (some girls/ some women).

As you can see plural article is translated as `some + noun`.

## Possessive articles
Possessive articles are like possessive adjectives in english, there are 6
possessive articles, 1 for each pronoun:

| Person | Singular          | Plural       |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1st    | mea (my)          | nea  (our)   |
| 2nd    | tea (your)        | vea  (your)  |
| 3rd    | sea (his/her/its) | esea (their) |

these are some examples:
 - mea dumus (my house);
 - esea patr (their father);
 - tea urbis (your city);

## Demonstrative articles (a & b)
As you saw earlier there are 2 demonstrative article (of type a and of type b),
which corresponds to the english `this` and `that`, in fact, the demonstrative
articles replace the demonstratives adjectives, let's see some examples:
 - ik kani (this dog);
 - il res (that thing);
 - ik dantis (this worker);
 - il fomina (that woman);

The demonstrative articles of type a is `ik` (translated as `this`) and the
demonstrative article of type b is `il` (translated as `that`)

## Exercises
Translate the following sentences in english:
 - mea kani;
 - esea dumus;
 - ik dantis;
 - ik fomina;

Translate the following sentences in VDF:
 - a dog;
 - my dog;
 - some workers;
 - this woman;
 - the man;

# Adjectives (Lesson III)
To get more specific about something we need to use adjectives and other nouns,
every noun specifying something comes after the noun, let's see some examples:
 - mea kani bel (my cool dog);
 - ik dumus pavus (this little house);
 - ofik magus (the big office);

**NOTE**: Normally adjectives end with -us.
